    Parameters
    ----------
    model : Model, optinoal
        The model to sample from. If None, use the model associated with the context.
    include : TAGS_TYPE
        The tags to include in the optimizations. Ignored if `rewriter` is not None.
    exclude : TAGS_TYPE
        The tags to exclude from the optimizations. Ignored if `rewriter` is not None.
    rewriter : RewriteDatabaseQuery (optional)
        The rewriter to use. If None, use the default rewriter with the given `include` and `exclude` tags.
    verbose : bool, default=False
        Print information about the optimizations applied.
